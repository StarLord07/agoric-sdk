Dimensions we need to test:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUN request meets the collateralization ratio test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User must have enough BLD to bond to meet the request,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUN minted does not cross the debt limit threshold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Repayment Examples,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User repays entire loan with RUN from their own purse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User repays partial loan with RUN from their own purse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUN reward stream pays down loan partially,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
